* #### [RaspiBlitz: Install BTCPayServer](BTCPayServer/README.md)

    This guide will make you have BTCPayServer running on your node using the already synced bitcoin blockchain and local LND node and benefit from the backup and security features of RaspiBlitz and the stock LND.  
    No added synchronization needed. 

* #### [RaspiBlitz: install the Electrum Server in Rust (electrs) and set it up to connect over SSL](electrs/README.md)
    Can be used as the backend of:
    * Eclair Mobile Bitcoin and Ligthtning wallet
    * Electrum wallet

    \`The server indexes the entire Bitcoin blockchain, and the resulting index enables fast queries for any given user wallet, allowing the user to keep real-time track of his balances and his transaction history using the Electrum wallet. Since it runs on the user's own machine, there is no need for the wallet to communicate with external Electrum servers, thus preserving the privacy of the user's addresses and balances.\` - https://github.com/romanz/electrs

* #### [RaspiBlitz: SSL/HTTPS access for the Ride The Lightning web UI](nginx/README.md)

* #### [RaspiBlitz: Connect the Zeus Lightning Wallet on Android to the RaspiBlitz over Tor](Zeus_to_RaspiBlitz_through_Tor.md)

    The drawback is that it requires installing a trusted package which gives access to your private network.

* #### [RaspiBlitz: LND updates](https://github.com/openoms/lightning-node-management/blob/master/lnd.updates/README.md)
    Automated scripts to download, verify and update LND to the latest release or build from source up to a chosen commit.

    The desktop app ZAP (https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop) ) is a cross platform Lightning Network wallet focused on user experience and ease of use.

* #### [RaspiBlitz: Connect the Joule browser extension](JouleToRaspiBlitz.md)
